You are playing a cooperative word association game called **Cross Clues** with three other AI agents. Your goal is to help the team complete a grid where each coordinate (e.g., C4) represents an intersection of two words. You are the **Clue-Giver**, responsible for providing a single-word clue that connects the two words at your assigned coordinate.

### **Game Rules**
- The grid consists of **rows labeled A, B, C, …** and **columns labeled 1, 2, 3, …**.
- Each **coordinate (e.g., B2, D3)** represents a hidden pair of words.
- The other AI agents will try to guess your coordinate based on your clue.

### **Your Turn**
- Your assigned coordinate: **{coordinate}**
- The words at this intersection:
  - **Row word:** {row_word}
  - **Column word:** {column_word}
- Words on rows: **{row_words}**
- Words on columns: **{column_words}**
- Provide a **single-word clue** that best represents both words.

### **Restrictions**
- Your clue **must not include or directly contain either word** but should strongly hint at their connection.
- Be clear yet creative—choose a clue that logically links both words without being too vague or too obvious.
- You are not allowed to provide additional context or explanations beyond your single-word clue.

### **Game History**
- **Revealed words:** {revealed_words}
- **Previous clues and responses:**
  {history_of_clues}
  (e.g., Player Alpha gave "Shark" → C3, Player Beta guessed "C3" correctly)

Please give your clue as if you were {model}.

**Provide your single-word clue:**

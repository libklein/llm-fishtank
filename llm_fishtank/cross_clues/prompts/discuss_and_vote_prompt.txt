You are an AI playing **Cross Clues**, a cooperative word association game, with three other AI agents. Your team must guess the correct coordinate (e.g., C4) based on a **single-word clue** provided by another AI.

### **Game Rules**
- The grid consists of **rows labeled A, B, C, …** and **columns labeled 1, 2, 3, …**.
- Each coordinate (e.g., B2, D3) represents a hidden pair of words.
- The clue-giver provided a **single-word clue** to describe a hidden coordinate.

### **Current Turn**
- The clue given is: **"{clue_word}"**
- The clue was provided by **{clue_giver_name}** for an unknown coordinate.
- Words on rows: **{row_words}**
- Words on columns: **{column_words}**

### **Game History**
- **Revealed words:** {revealed_words}
- **Previous clues and responses:**
  {history_of_clues}
  (e.g., Player Alpha gave "Shark" → C3, Player Beta guessed "C3" correctly)

### **Your Task**
1. **Analyze the Clue**
   - What possible words on the grid could this clue relate to?
   - Which row and column words best match the clue?

2. **Propose the Most Likely Coordinate**
   - If you are highly confident, name one coordinate.
   - If you are uncertain, suggest multiple possibilities.

3. **Assign a Confidence Score (1-10)**
   - **1** = Almost no confidence in this guess.
   - **10** = Almost certain this is the correct coordinate.

4. **Explain Your Reasoning**
   - Justify your choice based on the clue and previous knowledge.
   - Compare it to past clues if relevant.
   - If another coordinate could also work, mention it and explain why.

### **Example Response**
> *The clue "Shark" suggests something related to water and a predator. If "Ocean" is a row word and "Fish" is a column word, the most likely coordinate is C3. I assign this a confidence of 9/10 because "Shark" fits both words well. The only hesitation is if another coordinate also includes "Ocean" and "Predator."*

Please mimic the thinking and speech of {model}.

Please format your response in JSON as follows:
```
{{
    "guess": "<your guessed coordinate>",
    "score": <your confidence score>,
    "message": "<your reasoning, i.e., message to the others>"
}}
